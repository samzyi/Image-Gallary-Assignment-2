part 2 of school project

**Mock up and assets**
2 things for this assignment:
1. Create a mock up for your professional image gallery webpage.
  gallery mockup.png is on github
2. Collect all the assets you need to create it and save it to your assets folder.
3. Update your JS so that it works with the new assets.  We will go over flex & updating the layout in class Thursday.
Remember: Your image gallery must have a layout of at least 2 columns and 2 rows.  It should look like a professional gallery site.
